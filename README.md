<h4>Intake:</h4>

</p>
<p>
 First step in this process is the Intake. Intake is when a user submits a ticket to help desk for support or assistance. The user Karen will go to her company's support center to submit a ticket for the issue that is occurring. 
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
  Now once Karen is logged into her account she will begin to fill out a form that will have a help topic, ticket details, and a issue summary. When that is completed she will just submit it and go from there. 
</p>

</p>
<p>
  In the picture above, karen submitted the ticket and now an agent will be able to communicate with her about the issue that is occurring. This is important to continue to give updates and keep the user in the loop about whats going and/if there are any solutions. 
</p>
<br />

<h4>Assignment and Communication:</h4>

</p>
  The second step is Assignment and Communication. As we can see above the problem that is occuring is a mobile/online banking issue. This will be assigned to a certain department and a SLA will be set as well as the severity/time for this ticket. 
</p>

  </p>
  <p>
    Here you can see that the agent John made an update to the ticket. He updated the SLA and also added a comment about the entire system needing to be fixed. The user Karen is able to see this update as well, letting her know what is being done.
  </p>
<br />

<h4>Working the Ticket:</h4>

<p>

</p>
<p>
Next Step is working the ticket. This ticket was assigned to the online banking team. Agent Jane has officially took over thid ticket and is now working it, figuring out a solution. Agent Jane did indeed figure out a solution. Continuing to update the user, she replied to the ticket stating whas was going on and what needed to be done to fix the problem. 
</p>
<br />

<h4>Resolution:</h4>

<p>

</p>
<p>
Finally, a resolution was found. Agent Jane responded to the ticket stating that the system is going to need several updates. She will be restarting the system and running the updates, shouldn't take to long and the system will be back up shortly. Once this is completed. Jane can now mark that ticket as resolved, when she goes back to the dashboard she shouldn't see that ticket anymore. If you do want to see that ticket you can go to your closed tickets and pull it up.
